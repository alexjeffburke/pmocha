# Interactive mocha prompt

This is an experiment around an interactive prompt for the
[mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha)
test runner. Internally it uses the excellent
[imocha](https://github.com/gustavnikolaj/imocha)
to allow dynamic detection of file changes but adds extra
dynamic keys to the terminal interface.
